            <p>
              The SUAS Competition challenges student teams to design and
              demonstrate an autonomous UAS capable of flight, navigation,
              remote sensing, and task execution. Held annually at St. Mary's
              County Regional Airport, it emphasizes autonomy in missions such
              as obstacle avoidance, object detection, and air delivery. Teams
              are evaluated through a technical design review and a live mission
              demonstration.

              <h1>SUAS 2025 Mission Summary</h1>

              <p>
                The 2025 AUVSI SUAS competition challenges university teams to
                develop and operate a UAS capable of autonomous flight and
                completing a real-world inspired mission. The event includes
                multiple mission tasks, judged based on autonomy, accuracy,
                safety, and system engineering rigor.
              </p>

              <h2>Mission Tasks Overview</h2>

              <h3>1. Autonomous Flight</h3>
              <p>
                The UAS must take off, follow a specified flight path through
                multiple waypoints within a defined boundary, and land — all
                autonomously. Manual control is penalized and limits eligibility
                for full points.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Obstacle Avoidance</h3>
              <p>
                During autonomous flight, the UAS must avoid both static and
                dynamic obstacles, such as no-fly zones and simulated aircraft,
                using onboard sensing and processing.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Object Detection, Classification, and Localization</h3>
              <p>
                The UAS must capture aerial imagery of a defined search area and
                identify specific objects on the ground. It must classify each
                object's type, color, orientation, and shape, and report their
                GPS coordinates with high accuracy.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Air Delivery</h3>
              <p>
                The UAS must carry a payload and release it over a target zone
                autonomously. The drop must be accurate, and the payload must
                remain intact after landing.
              </p>

              <h2>Technical Evaluation</h2>

              <h3>Design Review & Readiness Presentation</h3>
              <p>
                Before flight, each team must present a detailed systems
                engineering review covering their design, testing, and safety
                protocols. Judges evaluate technical depth, engineering
                trade-offs, and readiness.
              </p>

              <h3>Flight Mission Demonstration</h3>
              <p>
                Points are awarded based on how well the UAS performs each task
                under mission conditions. Autonomy, safety compliance, and data
                accuracy are major scoring factors.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Analytical Modeling:</strong> The design was verified
              through a detailed MATLAB/Simulink model for aircraft dynamics,
              optimizing key parameters for mission requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flight Simulation:</strong> The optimized design was
              tested in the X-Plane flight simulator, confirming stability and
              performance predictions under various conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CFD Analysis:</strong> Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
              analyses, compared with theoretical values from wind-tunnel data,
              validated the aerodynamic model for lift, drag, and pitching
              moments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wind Tunnel Testing:</strong> Two wind-tunnel tests were
              conducted, measuring lift and drag to verify CFD and simulation
              predictions. Minor discrepancies led to design refinements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flight Testing:</strong> Three full-scale flight tests
              were performed with an instrumented UAV, logging data on
              performance metrics. Results closely matched theoretical
              predictions, confirming flight stability and endurance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payload Release Tests:</strong> Payload-drop experiments
              validated the release mechanism, with tuning adjusting the drop
              algorithm to meet mission tolerances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Iterative Process:</strong> Each testing phase informed
              design decisions, enhancing confidence in the overall performance
              of the SUAS 2025 design.
